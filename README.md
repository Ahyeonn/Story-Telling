# Strawberry-Fruit-Pie
This is a story-telling game that provides users with a variet of different story options to choose from.
Every time a user selects an option, the story leads to a different story room where the user may succeed or fail. 
This game is about a girl who is looking for ingredients in order to make a strawberry fruit pie.
Thus, she has to look for the required ingredients at the grocery store & within the forest.

When the girl acquires all of the required ingredients and brings it home to bake the strawberry fruit pie, you win the game.
But!!! During her exploration to retrieve the ingredients, she may encounter several traps that could lead the user to losing the game so be cautious. 

## Tools Used
I used the programming language, Python. 

## What is the motivation behind it?
I wanted to make a game with the language of Python because I found python challenging and I wanted to challenge myself by applying what I have learned & understood from my Python lessons.

## Why Strawberry-Fruit-Pie?
I was asked to make an exploration game about zombies or something aggressive, but since that is not my style for games, I decided to make a game that is not so violent so that everyone can enjoy my game.

## Getting Started
There are two ways to try out my game.

1. Download the codes from GitHub and run them through the Visual Studio Code with Terminal

2. Try my game at a supplement website, Replit in this URL :

## Problems that I faced
Since I am a beginner to Python, I faced several problems on how to apply my functions to display my game the specific way I wanted such as how to use the While Loop, For Loop, and If Else Statement properly.

## How I Solved My Problems
I was able to solve my problems by debugging my code at a test.py that I created, search for solutions from the class powerpoints, and tried the traceback method to solve the problems one by one.
