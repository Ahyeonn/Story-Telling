# Strawberry-Fruit-Pie
This is a story-telling game that provides the users with different options to choose from.
Every time when the user selects an option, the story leads to a different story room and the user may win or lose.

## Tools Used
I used the programming language, Python. 

## What is the motivation behind it?
I wanted to make a game with the language of Python because I found python challenging and I wanted to challenge myself by applying what I have learned & understood from my Python lessons.
