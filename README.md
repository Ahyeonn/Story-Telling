When the girl required all the ingredients and brings it home to bake the strawberry fruit pie, you win the game.
But!!! During her exploration to acquire ingredients, she may encounter several traps that could lead user to lost the game so be cautious. 

## Tools Used
I used the programming language, Python. 

## What is the motivation behind it?
I wanted to make a game with the language of Python because I found python challenging and I wanted to challenge myself by applying what I have learned & understood from my Python lessons.

## Why Strawberry-Fruit-Pie?
I was asked to make an exploration game about zombies or something aggressive but since that is not my preference for the game, I decided to make a game that is not violent so everyone can enjoy my game.

## Getting Started
There are two ways to try out my game.

1. Download the codes from GitHub and run them through the Visual Studio Code with Terminal

or

2. Try my game at a supplement website, Replit in this URL :

## Problems that I faced
Since I am a beginner to Python, I have faced several problems on how to apply my functions to work to display the way how I want my game to run. Such as how to use the While Loop, For Loop, and If Else Statement properly.

## How I Solved My Problems
I was able to solve my problems by debugging my code at a test.py that I created, search for solutions from the class powerpoints, and I tried the traceback method to solve the problem one by one.
